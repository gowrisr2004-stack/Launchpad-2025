About Me
Hi, I’m Gowri SR, a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering at ACE College of Engineering, Trivandrum.
I’m passionate about coding and  how it’s reshaping the world. I enjoy blending tech with real life — whether it’s vibe coding or exploring how it  can be part of everyday experiences.
I’m a fast learner, always curious, and constantly looking for ways to level up my skills- web development and app development.
